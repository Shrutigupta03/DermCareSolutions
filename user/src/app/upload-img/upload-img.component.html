                    condition that develops as a result of long-term sun exposure or ultraviolet (UV) radiation

                    skin
                    cancer development and can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Actinic
                    keratosis

                    from the sun. People with a history of frequent sunburns, outdoor occupations, or prolonged sun

                    Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, accounting for the majority
                    of
                    all skin cancer cases. It typically develops in the basal cells, which are found in the deepest
                    layer of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Basal cell carcinoma is generally
                    considered a slow-growing and less aggressive form of skin cancer compared to other types, such
                    as

                    reaction to minor trauma, such as insect bites, ingrown hairs, or injury to the skin. Some
                    researchers believe that dermatofibromas may be a form of scar tissue or a benign tumor of the
                    skin's connective tissue.

                    The exact cause of pyogenic granulomas is not always clear, but they often develop in response
                    to
                    minor trauma, such as a scratch, insect bite, injury, hormonal changes (as seen in pregnancy),
                    or
                    certain medications. These factors can trigger an abnormal response in the blood vessels,
                    leading to
                    the formation of the granuloma.

                    Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that originates in melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in
                    the
                    skin. It is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer and has the potential to spread to
                    other
                    parts of the body if not detected and treated early. Melanoma is less common than other skin
                    cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is much more likely to
                    metastasize (spread to other organs), making early diagnosis and intervention critical.

                    <br>
                    Melanoma can appear in various ways, but it often presents as a new, unusual, or changing mole.
                    The
                    ABCDE rule can help identify suspicious features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A: Asymmetry (one half of the mole does not match the other).</li>
                        <li>B: Border irregularity (edges are not well-defined).</li>
                        <li>C: Color variation (different colors within the same mole).</li>
                        <li>D: Diameter (greater than 6 millimeters).</li>
                        <li>E: Evolution (changes in size, shape, or other characteristics).</li>
                        However, not all melanomas follow these criteria, and some may have no pigment, making them
                        pink or
                        flesh-colored.
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    Melanoma can develop anywhere on the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun. In men,
                    it is most commonly found on the chest and back, while in women, it often occurs on the legs.

                    <strong style="font-size: 18px;">Causes:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Melanoma is primarily caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, tanning
                    beds,
                    or other sources. UV radiation can damage the DNA in melanocytes, leading to the development of
                    cancerous cells.
